        <h2>my trip to mexico 🇲🇽</h2>
		 <p>
			When I was just a teenager i went to mexico for a month. I was in a host family with a old lady that spent 60 years of her life working in her own restaurant making local dishes. During my first day in her house she made me try her mexican Taco. I literaly felt in love wth the taste so I asked her to teach me how to do that. That's where everything started.
